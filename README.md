# Credit_card_project
A kaggle dataset containing credit card transactions is analysed to detect frauds using Machine Learning.
## Workflow
1. Construct pandas dataframe after parsing a csv file
2. Preprocessing of dataframe to detect missing entries and identify datatypes
3. Statistical summary of dataframe
4. Eliminating bias in unbalanced dataset.
5. Implementing "Undersampling" to concatenate dataframes with identical distribution.
6. Identify features and target columns in dataframe.
7. Split new datframe into testing and training datasets.
8. Fit and train a Logistic regression model on traing datset.
9. valuste moel performance using training and testing accuracy scores.

## Outcome
Achieved training accuray score of 0.9940 and testing accuracy score of 0.9086 for the Logistic regression model.
